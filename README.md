# Gemini Citation Cleaner for Obsidian

This repository contains Templater scripts designed to strip citation tags (e.g., `[cite_start]`, `[cite: 900]`) from text generated by Google Gemini, making your notes clean and readable in Obsidian.

## Prerequisites

1. **Obsidian**: Ensure you have Obsidian installed.
2. **Templater Plugin**:
   - Go to Settings > Community Plugins > Browse
   - Search for Templater (by SilentVoid13) and install/enable it
   - Go to Settings > Templater
   - Set the "Template folder location" to the folder where you store your templates (e.g., `Templates/`)

## Installation

- Inside your Templates folder, create a new note named `Clean Whole Note.md`
- Copy the code from the `clean_gemini_whole_note.md` file provided previously
- Paste it into the note

## Usage

Use this if you have pasted a full article or chat log into a new note.

1. Open the note you want to clean
2. Ensure you are in Live Preview or Source Mode (not Reading view)
3. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`)
4. Type `Templater: Insert template`
5. Select `Clean Whole Note`
6. The entire document will be scrubbed of citation tags

## Tips

- **Hotkeys**: For faster access, go to Settings > Hotkeys, search for "Templater: Insert template", and assign a shortcut (e.g., `Alt + E`)
- **Regex Logic**: These scripts use the regex `/\[cite[^\]]*\]/g` to target any text starting with `[cite` and ending with the first `]`, ensuring it catches variations like `[cite_start]` and `[cite: 10]`
